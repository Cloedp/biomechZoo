13.09.2017 README for biomechZoo repository

biomechZoo is a user-customizable toolbox for the processing, analysis, and visualization of biomechanical movement data. 

Summary:
Movement data often contain variables recorded over time, for many subjects, groups, or conditions. The biomechZoo toolbox provides tools to help users achieve sort, process, statistically analyze, and visualize these data. 

Audience: 
biomechZoo can help those new to programming / biomechanics to quickly process their data by providing a framework from which to create a streamlined processing workflow. Advanced users are encouraged to contribute to the biomechZoo project by providing additional functions. 

Web:

Help: 
Help for biomechZoo can be accessed via the biomechZoo-help repository (https://github.com/PhilD001/biomechZoo-help). This repository provides exercises, sample data, and other resources to help the user get started with biomechZoo. Additional help may be obtained via seminars (see website for announcements) or
by contacting the main author. 

Additional Software / Platform information: 
Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA) v2016a or newer software running, at minimum, the Signal processing and Statistics toolboxes

The biomechZoo toolbox, was tested on Mac (OSX 10.11.5, Matlab v2016b),  Windows 10 Enterprise (Matlab 2015a and 2016a), and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) platforms. 

Users interested in developing a version of biomechZoo to run in an open-source programming environment such as Python should email the main author

Notes: 
biomechZoo software is in constant development. We are working to improve functionality and user experience with every version. The current version is always on the Github repository. 
The original public release version is also stored on GitHub as a zip file.
