biomechZoo is a user-customizable toolbox for the processing, analysis, and visualization of biomechanical movement data. 


Summary:
Movement data often contain variables recorded over time, for many subjects, groups, or conditions. The biomechZoo toolbox provides tools to help users achieve sort, process, statistically analyze, and visualize these data.

Getting started: 
The biomechZoo toolbox can be downloaded by clicking on the green 'Clone or download' button on the main repository page (above). 

Afterwards, biomechZoo can be loaded into Matlab by running the startZoo.m file located in the root biomechZoo folder.
 
Users can consult the help (https://github.com/PhilD001/biomechZoo-help) and sample-study data ("https://github.com/PhilD001/biomechZoo-samplestudy) repositories to become familiar with the main processing, analysis, and visualization tools.

Additional help may be obtained by contacting the main author. 

Audience: 
biomechZoo can help those new to programming / biomechanics to quickly process their data by providing a framework from which to create a streamlined processing workflow. Advanced users are encouraged to contribute to the biomechZoo project by providing additional functions. 

Additional Software / Platform information: 
Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA) software running, at minimum, the Signal processing and Statistics toolboxes

The biomechZoo toolbox, was tested on Mac (OSX 10.11.5, Matlab v2016b) and Windows 10 Enterprise (Matlab 2015a and 2016a) platforms. biomechZoo has not been tested on Linux machines.

Users interested in developing a version of biomechZoo to run in an open-source programming environment such as Python should email the main author.
