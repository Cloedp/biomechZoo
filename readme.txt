The Zoosystem is a user-customizable Matlab toolbox for the analysis of biomechanical movement data. 

Summary:
Movement data often contain variables recorded over time, for many subjects, groups, or conditions. The Zoosystem provides tools to help users achieve sort, process, statistically analyze, and visualize these data. 

Quick look:

Getting started: 
The Zoosystem can be downloaded by clicking on the green 'Clone or download' button on the main repository page (above). 
Afterwards, the Zoosystem can be loaded into Matlab by running the startZoo.m file located in the root Zoosystem folder. 
Users can consult the <a href="https://github.com/PhilD001/the-zoosystem-help">help</a> section or explore the 
<a href="https://github.com/PhilD001/the-zoosystem-samplestudy">sample study</a>' to become familiar with the main processing, analysis, and visualization tools.

Additional help may be obtained by contacting the main author (philippe dot dixon at gmail dot com).


Audience: 
The Zoosystem can help those new to programming / biomechanics to quickly process their data by providing a framework from which to create a streamlined processing workflow. Advanced users are encouraged to contribute to the Zoosystem project by providing additional functions.


Additional Software / Platform information: 
Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA) software running, at minimum, the Signal processing and Statistics toolboxes

The Zoosystem toolbox was tested on Mac (OSX 10.8.5, Matlab v2012a and v2014b), Windows 7 Enterprise (Matlab 2014a and 2016a) and Windows 10 (Matlab 2016a) platforms. The Zoosystem has not been tested on Linux machines.73 operating systems.


Users interested in developing a version of the Zoosystem to run in an open-source programming environment such as Python could email the main author.
