README

These files are part of the 'Kinemat' toolbox of  Reinschmidt and Van den Bogert
see: http://isbweb.org/software/movanal/kinemat/

Additional files and changes for integration into the Zoosystem toolbox
-bmech_kinemat: batch processing file to compute kinematics across all zoo files
-kinemat: file to compute kinematics for a single zoo file struc (data)
-rad2deg and deg2rad were renamed to avoid potential name conflict with 
 existing zoo files. The zoo system equivalent functions should perform in the 
 same manner
